Usage

1. Craft a frame (see the Recipes page for crafting details: [Recipes](./recipe)).
2. Place an Item Frame or a Painting in the world.
3. Hold Shift (sneak) and right-click the crafted Frame onto the placed Item Frame or Painting to attach it.
4. To remove the Frame and retrieve it, break the Frame or break the Painting/Item Frame it's attached to — the Frame will drop so you can pick it up again.

Notes

- "Hold Shift" refers to the sneak key (usually <kbd>Shift</kbd> by default).
- If a Frame doesn't attach, ensure the target is a valid Item Frame or Painting and you're sneaking while clicking.
- See the Recipes page for the exact crafting ingredients: [Recipes](./recipe)
