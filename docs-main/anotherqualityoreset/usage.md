## Getting Started

Another Quality Ore Set adds new ores that spawn naturally in your Minecraft world. Here's how to get started:

### Finding Ores

- **Easium Ore** - Found in the overworld, easiest to find of the three
- **Medium Ore** - Found in the nether.
- **Hardium Ore** - Found in the end.

### Smelting

Smelt the raw ores in a furnace or blast furnace to obtain ingots:
- Raw Easium → Easium Ingot
- Raw Medium → Medium Ingot
- Raw Hardium → Hardium Ingot

### Crafting Equipment

Once you have ingots, you can craft:
- Full armor sets (helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots)
- Standard tools (sword, pickaxe, axe, shovel, hoe)
- Special tools (hammer, paxel, tree axe, rod)

### End-Game: Telos

To craft Telos gear, you'll need:
1. Create rods from each tier (Easium Rod, Medium Rod, Hardium Rod)
2. Obtain Dragon's Breath from the Ender Dragon
3. Combine them to create Telos Scrap
4. Use Telos Scrap to craft the most powerful armor and weapons


## Special Tools

### Hammer
A 3x3 mining tool that breaks multiple blocks at once. Great for clearing large areas quickly.

### Paxel
A combination tool that functions as a pickaxe, axe, and shovel. Requires all three base tools to craft.

### Tree Axe
Chops down entire trees at once. One swing and the whole tree falls!

### Rod
A crafting component used in various recipes, including Telos gear.
