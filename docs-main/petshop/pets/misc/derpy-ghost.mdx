The **Derpy Ghost** is an adorably goofy spectral companion. With its cute, derpy expression and wobbly floating movements, this ghost is more likely to make you smile than scare you.

Derpy Ghosts are friendly and playful despite their spooky origins. They love floating around their owners and making silly faces. Their transparent, ethereal form glows softly in the dark, making them perfect companions for nighttime adventures.

Give your Derpy Ghost **pancakes** as treats to attract their attention and watch them display cute animations!
