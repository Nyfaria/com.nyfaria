The **Mossflare** is a tiny greenish-blue dragon with an earthy charm. Its scales blend beautiful shades of green and blue, evoking the colors of moss-covered stones near crystal-clear water.

These little guys are calm and gentle companions. Mossflares love to perch on their owner's shoulder and observe the world around them. Their serene nature makes them perfect pets for builders and explorers alike.
