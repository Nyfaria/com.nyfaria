The **Aurora** is a tiny purplish-pink dragon with a magical shimmer. Its scales transition beautifully between purple and pink hues, reminiscent of the northern lights.

Despite its small size, Aurora has a big personality. These little guys are playful and curious, always eager to explore their surroundings. They make wonderful companions for adventurers who want a touch of magic in their travels.
