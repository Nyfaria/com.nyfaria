Each pet in Pet Shop has realistic behaviors that make them feel like real companions.

## Pet Modes

Each pet has three modes: **Stay**, **Follow**, and **Wander**. To change your pet's activated mode, simply crouch and right-click your pet with an empty hand. The current mode of the pet will be displayed on screen.

## Hunger and Thirst

Each pet also has a **hunger and thirst** level. Like real-life pets, you need to make sure your pets are constantly well-fed and have adequate water!

Get some pet bowls from the Pet Groomer villager (ideally one for food and one for water). Fill one with kibble (using a kibble packet) and one with water (using a water bucket), and then from there, your pets will automatically eat and drink when they are hungry.

## Sleeping

Cats and dogs can **sleep** with a proper animation! This mod adds new pet beds (a small and large size) which you can place down. If there is a pet bed near which isn't occupied, pets will sleep when it's night time (only if they are set to wander).

## Playing Fetch

Both dogs and cats can play **fetch** with you! Simply acquire a tennis ball, right click it to throw, and watch as your pets scurry for the ball and then return it to you.

## Dog Digging

If you don't have a brush with you, no problem! Dogs can **dig up suspicious blocks** for you! They don't give you the item though, so you have to go and get the dug-up item yourself.

## Parrots on Shoulders

You can **put parrots on your shoulder**! Simply right click your parrot while it is on stay mode and it will go on your shoulder. You can also choose to put your parrots in bird cages - if you right click an empty bird cage while you have a parrot on your shoulder, the parrot will transfer to the bird cage.

## Pet Treats

You can give all of your pets **treats**! Each type of pet has a dedicated pet treat item:

- **Dogs** - Dog treat
- **Cats** - Tuna treat
- **Parrots** - Peanuts
- **Dragons** - Chicken drumstick
- **Derpy Ghost** - Pancakes

Holding these items in hand will attract the attention of your pets (and they will display a cute animation).

## Petting

And lastly, you can **pet your pets** by simply right clicking them. Who doesn't want a little love?
