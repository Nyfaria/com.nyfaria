Welcome! This site is the central hub for my Minecraft mods, documentation, and modding resources.
{/* truncate */}
You'll find up-to-date docs for each mod, crafting recipes and examples, installation instructions, and links to the official downloads on Modrinth and CurseForge. If you're a modder, you'll also find notes for creating addons and integrating with these mods.

If you want to contribute, report an issue, or get help, head to the GitHub repositories linked throughout the docs or join the community on Discord. Thanks for stopping by — I hope these resources help you build and enjoy great modded experiences.
